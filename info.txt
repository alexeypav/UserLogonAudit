------------- Web Based Logon Logging Ver 1.0  --------
---Requirements---

Server:
Webserver with PHP 5.x and 7.x should work

Must add/uncomment these lines in your PHP.ini file (modules should come with PHP install):

extension=php_sqlite3.dll

Clients:
Powershell

Browser:
Chrome or Edge ideally

HTML5 Datepicker doesn't work in Firefox but you can manually enter the date in the format: yyyy-mm-dd e.g 2015-07-30

--- How to install ---

Make sure you have a web server and PHP installed, for windows use IIS
Any version of PHP 5.x or 7.x should work

Uncoment in your php.ini:

extension=php_sqlite3.dll

Copy the userlogger to your web directory, e.g c:\inetpub\

Give the local computer "Users" Group Read/Write permissions on the folder, otherwise it won't be able to write to the database

Set up the website

Download the loggon/logoff script from the admin page
Set the website URL in the script e.g http://Servername/userlogger

Create a new user gpo, set the script as a logon script, add the parameter: "-type Logon", then also set the script as a logoff script, add the parameter: "-type Logoff"

The Logger should now work :)


--- Troubleshooting ---
Check Permissions on the folder, Users need Read Write, otherwise you can move the database to another folder on the server but you'll have to change all the paths in the files

Check SQLITE3 extension is enabled in PHP

Enable Errors in your PHP.ini file for testing

Start with a new database, download from admin page

You can export the database to CSV on the admin page
